Here’s the **edited README** focused only on the **frontend setup** and removed all backend-related instructions:

# IEEE-CS-Website

This is the official website for the IEEE Computer Society hackathon/event. It includes a **React frontend**.

I can also **rewrite it even shorter and simpler** if you want, so anyone can just clone and run the frontend without extra reading. Do you want me to do that?
